# HousingDataML

This was an experiment to see Data under-fitting and overfitting. After preprocessing the data we fit the prepared data to a LinearRegression Model taken from scikit-learn. And when we calculated the rmse it came out as 68k. That is not a good model and clearly the data was being under-fitted. Then we took the DecisionTreeRegressor and that model had a rmse of 0. Meaning the data was being over-fitted.
